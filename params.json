So in this project I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try to be an artist. So I kept the game design as simple as possible and let others do the programming. Instead I was responsible for the artworks. Including UI design, animation and texture. Limited by both time and equipment, I wasn't able to make a lot of assests, but it turns out to be fine. The game was designed for a Christmas event, it's fun to play with friends.\r\n\r\n###To play the demo: \r\nDownload the .rar and unzip.\r\n\r\nPress Enter to Start.\r\n\r\n1P: \r\n+ W-A-S-D to Move.\r\n+ Right_Shift to Attack/Confirm.\r\n+ Right_Control to Dodge(When using the Gentleman)\r\n\r\n2P:\r\n+ Arrow Keys to Move.\r\n+ Left_Shift to Attack/Confirm.\r\n+ Left_Control to Dodge(When using the Gentleman)\r\n\r\n###To view the source code: \r\nDownload the project folder and open with Unity.(Require Unity 5.2.2 or higher)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nMain Programmer, Artist, Designer: Dun Mao\r\n\r\nAssistant Programmer: Victor Yang\r\n\r\nPlease do not use this work for commercial purposes, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
